## the loop is like a repetitive routine or a cycle that allows you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times. 
It's a way to tell the computer to keep doing something until a specific condition is met or for a certain number of times.

## The for loop is typically used when you know the exact number of iterations/loops or when you need to iterate over a range of values.
The while loop is typically used when you need to repeatedly execute a block of code until a specific condition becomes false or true.

EXAMPLE

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    System.out.println("Hello world!");

    int i = 1; // 1
          //1 <= 10 -> TRUE
          //2 <= 10 -> TRUE
          //3 <= 10 -> TRUE
          //...
          //11 <= 10 -> FALSE
    while (i <= 10) {
      String result = ""; // Result
      if (i % 2 == 0) { //Odd or even
        result = "even";
      } else {
        result = "odd";
      }
                        //1 odd
                        //2 even
      System.out.println(i + " " + result);
      i = i + 1; // i = i + 1;
      //i = 1 + 1;
      //i = 2 + 1;
      //i = 3 + 1;
    }
  }
}





ANOTHER EXAMPLE 

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int i = 1;
    while (i <= 10) {
      // Start action

      System.out.println(i);
      // End action
      i = i + 1;
    }
  }
}


ANOTHER EXAMPLE


   // int i = 1 Defined at the start
    // i <= 10 A condition to check before starting the loop
    // i = 
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i = i + 1){
      System.out.println(i);
    }

## MAKING A TRIANGLE 

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

    Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
    System.out.println("Let's make a triangle!");
    System.out.println("Enter a positive whole number: ");
    int number = scanner.nextInt();

    for (int i = 0; i <= number; i++) {
      String line = "_";
      System.out.println(line.repeat(i));  
   }
  }  
}


## NUMBER GUESSING GAME

import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {

Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int numberToGuess = (int) (Math.random() * 101); // Generates a random number between 0 and 100
        int guess = -1; // Initialize the guess to a value outside the valid range

        System.out.println("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!");
        System.out.println("Try to guess a number between 0 and 100.");

        while (guess != numberToGuess) {
            System.out.print("Enter your guess: ");
            guess = scanner.nextInt();

            if (guess < numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("The number is bigger than your guess.");
            } else if (guess > numberToGuess) {
                System.out.println("The number is smaller than your guess.");
            } else {
                System.out.println("Congratulations! You've guessed the correct number: " + numberToGuess);
            }
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
